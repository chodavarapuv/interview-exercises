## Instructions to run this app locally on your machine

Note : These instructions are tested on a MAC only. 

- This exercise is done using react and I have created this app using 'create-react-app' and npm. So you need to have nodejs and npm installed on your machine.
- Clone this repo and navigate to the folder - 'interview-exercises/UI-user-feed/social-media-feed '.
- In this folder from the commandline, run the command 'npm start'. This should start a local server and the app should now be running at 'http://localhost:3000/'
