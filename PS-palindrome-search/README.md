Note : These instructions are tested on a MAC only. 

- Install node on your machine.
- From command line, Navigate to this folder and run the command 'node secondLongestPalindrome.js'
- Currently, I am passing a test string 'abffffba' to the method in the script. This needs to be modified to the string that needs to be tested.
